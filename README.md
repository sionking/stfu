# stfu

`stfu` is a node package that uses Instagram's `Mute` feature to mute _ALL_ the accounts you follow.

 ### Configurable Options in .env

 * DELAY_IN_SECONDS - Avoid being "suspended" by Instagram by choosing a DELAY_IN_SECONDS between requests

 * Specify a WHITELIST of accounts to UNmute().

 * Mute/Unmute up to MAX_USERS accounts (instead of all 100's or 1000's of accounts at once).
